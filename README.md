**Color Prediction**

This model implements a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory that uses a custom dataset created by me. The model is trained on this dataset to predict colors based on a user inputted query. The model is trained on a relation between color names and their respecitve rgb values.


**Model Hyperparameters**

The model has 68K trainable parameters and is trained for 150 epochs with a validation and dropout of 0.2. The model also has a batch size of 64 all these hyperparamters help the model to achieve an accuracy of 61%.

**Possible Applications**
* Create realistic visual effects in movies and video games.

* Develop new ways to design and manufacture products.

* Improve the accuracy of medical imaging.

* Develop new ways to interact with computers and other devices.


**Note: This model is still under developement and is not final. Still wokring on improving the acuracy and increasing my datasets size**
