**Color Prediction**
--------------------------------------------

This model implements a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory that uses a custom dataset created by me. The model is trained on this dataset to predict colors based on a user inputted query. The model is trained on a relation between color names and their respecitve RGB values.


**Model Hyperparameters**
------------------------------------

The model has 627K trainable parameters and is trained for 350 epochs with a validation and dropout of 0.2. The model also has a batch size of 256 all these hyperparamters help the model to achieve an accuracy of 73%.
