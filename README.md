**Color Prediction**
--------------------------------------------

This model implements a Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory that uses a custom dataset created by me. The model is trained on this dataset to predict colors based on a user inputted query. The model is trained on a relation between color names and their respecitve rgb values.


**Model Hyperparameters**
------------------------------------

The model has 620K trainable parameters and is trained for 600 epochs with a validation and dropout of 0.2. The model also has a batch size of 256 all these hyperparamters help the model to achieve an accuracy of .



**Results**
-------------------------------------------------


**Possible Applications**
-------------------------------------
* Create realistic visual effects in movies and video games.

* Develop new ways to design and manufacture products.

* Improve the accuracy of medical imaging.



**Note: This model is still under developement and is not final. Still working on improving the acuracy and increasing my datasets size**
